### Face Plate

Required for E2-A.  

Recommended material: Aluminium (Anodized if possible).  Currently looking into possibility of 3D printing this component for those who do not have access to mill.

Note: Contours in recessed slots is not strictly required, but highly recommended to prevent contact by the conductors.

### L-Bracket

Optional equipment for E2-A.  Allows mounting on 3 sides of strobe.

Recommended material: Aluminum or Steel

Note:  Contours are primarily asthetic and are not required.
